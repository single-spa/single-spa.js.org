Single-spa offers a CLI for those who prefer autogenerated and managed configurations for webpack, babel, jest, etc. You do not have to use the CLI in order to use single-spa.

The CLI is called `create-single-spa` ([Github link](https://github.com/single-spa/create-single-spa/)). It is intended for the creation of new projects and for updating projects that were created via `create-single-spa`, but it is not intended for migrating pre-existing codebases to single-spa.

## Installation and Usage

If you wish to have create-single-spa globally available, run the following in a terminal

```sh
npm install --global create-single-spa

# or
yarn global add create-single-spa
```

Alternatively, you may use create-single-spa without global installation:

```sh
npm init single-spa

# or
npx create-single-spa

# or 
yarn create single-spa
```

This will open up a CLI prompt asking you what kind of project you want to create or update. create-single-spa **installs into the current directory**, so be sure to create an empty directory if you're starting from scratch.

## Project types

create-single-spa asks you if you'd like to create a single-spa application, a utility module, or a root-config. All three module types assume that you are using the [recommended setup](/docs/recommended-setup).

If you select that you'd like to create a single-spa application, you will be prompted for which framework you'd like to choose. React is implemented with premade configurations for babel + webpack + jest. Angular is implemented with Angular CLI and [single-spa-angular](). Vue is implemented with Vue CLI and [vue-cli-plugin-single-spa](/ecosystem/ecosystem-vue#vue-cli).

# NPM packages

Within the create-single-spa repo, there are several NPM packages. The following sections document each package:

## create-single-spa

[Github project](https://github.com/single-spa/create-single-spa/tree/master/packages/create-single-spa)

The core CLI, which invokes [generator-single-spa](#generator-single-spa).

## generator-single-spa

[Github project](https://github.com/single-spa/create-single-spa/tree/master/packages/generator-single-spa)

A [Yeoman generator](https://yeoman.io/) that prompts the user and then creates files. This is primarily invoked via the create-single-spa CLI, but can also be [composed](https://yeoman.io/authoring/composability.html) if you'd like to customize it.

## webpack-config-single-spa

[Github project](https://github.com/single-spa/create-single-spa/tree/master/packages/webpack-config-single-spa)

A shareable, customizable webpack config that is used for utility modules and React single-spa applications.

### Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev webpack-config-single-spa webpack-merge

yarn add --dev webpack-config-single-spa webpack-merge
```

### Usage

```js
const webpackMerge = require('webpack-merge');
const singleSpaDefaults = require('webpack-config-single-spa');

module.exports = webpackConfigEnv => {
  const defaultConfig = singleSpaDefaults({
    // The name of the organization this application is written for
    orgName: 'name-of-company',
    // The name of the current project. This usually matches the git repo's name
    projectName: 'name-of-project',
    // If your project uses typescript, set typecheck. Otherwise, omit it.
    typecheck: 'typescript',
    // Set to true if your project uses react
    react: true,
    // See https://webpack.js.org/guides/environment-variables/#root for explanation of webpackConfigEnv
    webpackConfigEnv,
  })

  return webpackMerge.smart(defaultConfig, {
    // modify the webpack config however you'd like to by adding to this object
  })
}
```

## webpack-config-single-spa-react

[Github project](https://github.com/single-spa/create-single-spa/tree/master/packages/webpack-config-single-spa-react)

A shareable, customizable webpack config that adds react-specific configuration to `webpack-config-single-spa`.

### Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev webpack-config-single-spa-react webpack-merge

yarn add --dev webpack-config-single-spa-react webpack-merge
```

### Usage

```js
const webpackMerge = require('webpack-merge');
const singleSpaDefaults = require('webpack-config-single-spa');

module.exports = webpackConfigEnv => {
  const defaultConfig = singleSpaDefaults({
    // The name of the organization this application is written for
    orgName: 'name-of-company',
    // The name of the current project. This usually matches the git repo's name
    projectName: 'name-of-project',
    // See https://webpack.js.org/guides/environment-variables/#root for explanation of webpackConfigEnv
    webpackConfigEnv,
  })

  return webpackMerge.smart(defaultConfig, {

  })
}
