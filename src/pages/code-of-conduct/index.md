# single-spa Code of Conduct

The single-spa code of conduct defines the rules that all single-spa maintainers and community members must follow in single-spa related online and in-person spaces and interactions. Violation of the code of conduct may result in bans, removal, or other disciplinary action.

## Harassment and Discrimination

Harassment within the single-spa community is forbidden. The single-spa open source community is built on goodwill across people from various cultures and groups. 

Harassment can involve (but is not limited to) unwanted communication, not leaving someone alone, online or in-person stalking, teasing, doxing, the use of slurs, and various other behaviors. Any person within the single-spa community who is harassed should report it, as defined below.

Discrimination against single-spa community members by the core team or other members is also forbidden.

## Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

The single-spa community hopes to invite and include diverse peoples to participate, both as community members and leaders. The open source software world is often dominated by rich, White, English-speaking men, which creates problematic dynamics for people of other groups. We hope to counteract those dynamics via a commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion.

The single-spa community is committed to intersectional consideration and appropriate accommodation for people of various identities. We wish the community to be safe from discrimination and harassment. At least the following factors of someone's identity are protected and will be considered:

- race
- sex
- languages spoken / English-proficiency
- place of residence
- wealth
- sexual orientation
- gender identity and expression (pronouns are respected in our community)
- religious identity
- ethnic identity
- physical disability
- mental disability and/or neurodivergence
- software experience level / technical ability

Behaviors that exhibit any of the following will not be tolerated:

- white supremacy
- sexism
- misogyny
- Western/American/European supremacy
- homophobia, biphobia, lesbophobia, transphobia, queerphobia, acephobia, arophobia, and any other anti-LGBTQIA+ bigotry
- pedophilia
- Nonconsensual sexualization

We encourage any single-spa community member who experiences discrimination or harassment to report it, even if the basis of the discrimination or harassment isn't listed above.

## Direct Messages

Direct messages and direct emails to single-spa's creator, core team, and maintainers are discouraged. Please use publicly visible channels instead, such as the #general channel in Slack or public Github issues. Public visibility makes it easier for the interaction to be safe and avoid problematic dynamics.

Direct messages with others within single-spa spaces should remain appropriate. Communication in single-spa related online spaces should be

## Reporting and Arbitration

To report harassment, contact a single-spa core team member, community manager, or single-spa's creator. This can be done in Slack, over email (singlespa.info@gmail.com or joeldenning@gmail.com), or send a DM to an single-spa social media account.

Single-spa's creator and community managers will review the report. Witnesses or experts who can help understand the situation may be brought in to evaluate the situation. Community members found to have harassed or discriminated against another member may be warned, limited, or banned. To the extent possible, the single-spa community aims to be a safe place.
