# Single-spa governance

## Overview and scope

The single-spa project consists of various software projects, documentation resources, and community resources that are freely available for corporations, governments, and nonprofits to use when creating websites. It was started in 2015 by Joel Denning.

Single-spa is not owned by any individual, corporation, or legal entity, but rather is communally owned by its creator, maintainers, and users. Its users span across the globe and various jurisdictions. Due to its open source license, single-spa provides no guarantees to its users. It is the intention and hope of single-spa’s creator, maintainers, and users that no political or legal tension or intervention will prevent the single-spa community from continuing to use and improve the software.

This single-spa governance document outlines how the single-spa software project and its community operate, including which people and groups have official influence over it.

## Community governance

Single-spa discussions are held in the single-spa Slack workspace and on Github.

## Technical governance
The single-spa core team, maintainers, and creator may periodically hold meetings to discuss the current status and roadmap of single-spa. The creator has final say over all technical decisions. The core team helps out in day-to-day maintenance of the project, new feature initiatives, and roadmap.

For transparency to the broader community, meeting notes are published on the single-spa blog.

## Funding

The single-spa project accepts voluntary donations via single-spa’s Open Collective. Single-spa’s creator accepts donations via Github sponsors. Budgeting and dispensing of single-spa Open Collective funds is controlled by single-spa’s creator, including paying the creator, core team, and maintainers for their labor.
