        The loading function for {props.getErrorCodeArg(0, "application")} {props.getErrorCodeArg(1)} returned a promise that resolved with
        something that is not an object. The loading function should resolve with an application object that has the
        single-spa lifecycle functions on it.

        The resolved value for the application was was {props.getErrorCodeArg(2)}
