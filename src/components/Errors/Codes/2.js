      <h2>Explanation:</h2>
      <p>
        The single-spa start() API exists to give you fine-grained control over performance. In the majority of use cases, you should call singleSpa.start() immediately after <a href="http://localhost:3000/docs/api#registerapplication">registering your applications</a>.
        It was designed for situations where you want to start downloading a single-spa application's code while you're waiting for initial user data or context. To do that, call registerApplication()
        immediately but delay calling start until the data is loaded.
