      <h1>#1: singleSpa.start() was not called</h1>
      <p>
        <a href="/docs/api#start">singleSpa.start()</a> has not been called, 5000ms after single-spa was loaded. Before start() is called, apps can be declared and loaded, but not bootstrapped or mounted.
      </p>
      <h2>To fix:</h2>
      <div>
        <CodeSnippet>
          {`
            // Insert this into your single-spa root config
            singleSpa.start();
          `}
        </CodeSnippet>
      </div>
      <h2>Explanation:</h2>
      <p>
        The single-spa start() API exists to give you fine-grained control over performance. In the majority of use cases, you should call singleSpa.start() immediately after <a href="http://localhost:3000/docs/api#registerapplication">registering your applications</a>.
        It was designed for situations where you want to start downloading a single-spa application's code while you're waiting for initial user data or context. To do that, call registerApplication()
        immediately but delay calling start until the data is loaded.
