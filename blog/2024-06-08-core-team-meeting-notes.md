## Changes to governance and code of conduct

A [single-spa governance document](https://single-spa.js.org/governance/) is published, intended to clarify the role of Joel Denning as creator, the core team, maintainers, and community managers.

A new [single-spa code of conduct](https://single-spa.js.org/code-of-conduct/) has been published. The original code of conduct was adopted from a template created by the TODO Group. That template [is no longer being updated and has been abandoned](https://todogroup.org/blog/followup-open-code-of-conduct/).

## Core team changes

Carlos Filoteo is no longer on the single-spa core team, after discussing it with him after over a year of inactivity. Anthony Frehner will stay on as an inactive member, for now.

This means that the core team consists of the following members:

- Joel Denning (creator)
- Ian Bacher
- Milan Kovacic
- Artur Androsovich
- Anthony Frehner (inactive)
