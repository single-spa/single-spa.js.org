title: Shared Webpack configs
---

single-spa also publishes a few shared Webpack config packages that include basics needed for creating single-spa applications. These configs are used by applications generated with [create-single-spa](/docs/create-single-spa), and can be used as a starting point to extend/modify a custom configuration for your organization/team.

These packages are housed within the [create-single-spa repository](https://github.com/single-spa/create-single-spa/tree/main/packages).

## webpack-config-single-spa

[Github project](https://github.com/single-spa/create-single-spa/tree/master/packages/webpack-config-single-spa)

A shareable, customizable webpack config that is used for single-spa modules.

### Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev webpack-config-single-spa webpack-merge

# or
yarn add --dev webpack-config-single-spa webpack-merge
```

### Usage

```js
const singleSpaDefaults = require("webpack-config-single-spa");
const { merge } = require("webpack-merge"); // webpack-merge@5.0.3+

module.exports = (webpackConfigEnv, argv) => {
  const defaultConfig = singleSpaDefaults({
    // The name of the organization this application is written for
    orgName: "name-of-company",
    // The name of the current project. This usually matches the git repo's name
    projectName: "name-of-project",
    // See https://webpack.js.org/guides/environment-variables/#root for explanation of webpackConfigEnv
    webpackConfigEnv,
    // The CLI commands in the package.json script that triggered this build
    argv,
    // optional
    // This changes whether package names that start with @your-org-name are
    // treated as webpack externals or not. Defaults to true
    orgPackagesAsExternal: true,

    // optional, defaults to 1
    // This is the rootDirectoryLevel that is passed to https://github.com/joeldenning/systemjs-webpack-interop
    rootDirectoryLevel: 1,

    // optional, defaults to false
    // Disable html-webpack-plugin (and standalone-single-spa-webpack-plugin) entirely
    // This is intended for root configs, but can be used in other cases, too
    disableHtmlGeneration: false,
  });

  return merge(defaultConfig, {
    // modify the webpack config however you'd like to by adding to this object
  });
};
```

## webpack-config-single-spa-react

[Github project](https://github.com/single-spa/create-single-spa/tree/master/packages/webpack-config-single-spa-react)

A shareable, customizable webpack config that adds react-specific configuration to `webpack-config-single-spa`.

### Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev webpack-config-single-spa-react webpack-merge

# or
yarn add --dev webpack-config-single-spa-react webpack-merge
```

### Usage

```js
const singleSpaDefaults = require('webpack-config-single-spa-react');
const webpackMerge = require('webpack-merge');

module.exports = (webpackConfigEnv, argv) => {
  const defaultConfig = singleSpaDefaults({
    // The name of the organization this application is written for
    orgName: 'name-of-company',
    // The name of the current project. This usually matches the git repo's name
    projectName: 'name-of-project',
    // See https://webpack.js.org/guides/environment-variables/#root for explanation of webpackConfigEnv
    webpackConfigEnv,
    // The CLI commands in the package.json script that triggered this build
    argv,
    // optional
    // This changes whether package names that start with @your-org-name are
    // treated as webpack externals or not. Defaults to true
    orgPackagesAsExternal: true,

    // optional, defaults to 1
    // This is the rootDirectoryLevel that is passed to https://github.com/joeldenning/systemjs-webpack-interop
    rootDirectoryLevel: 1,

    // optional, defaults to {}
    // This controls the options given to standalone-single-spa-webpack-plugin
    // See https://github.com/single-spa/standalone-single-spa-webpack-plugin#usage
    standaloneOptions: {},
  });

     // modify the webpack config however you'd like to by adding to this object
  });
};
```

## webpack-config-single-spa-ts

[Github project](https://github.com/single-spa/create-single-spa/tree/master/packages/webpack-config-single-spa-ts)

A shareable, customizable webpack config that adds typescript-specific configuration to `webpack-config-single-spa`. Note that webpack-config-single-spa-ts has a peerDependency on `typescript`.

### Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev webpack-config-single-spa-ts webpack-merge

# or
yarn add --dev webpack-config-single-spa-ts webpack-merge
```

### Usage

```js
const webpackMerge = require("webpack-merge");
const singleSpaDefaults = require("webpack-config-single-spa-ts");

module.exports = (webpackConfigEnv, argv) => {
  const defaultConfig = singleSpaDefaults({
    // The name of the organization this application is written for
    orgName: "name-of-company",
    // The name of the current project. This usually matches the git repo's name
    projectName: "name-of-project",
    // See https://webpack.js.org/guides/environment-variables/#root for explanation of webpackConfigEnv
    webpackConfigEnv,
    // The CLI commands in the package.json script that triggered this build
    argv,
  });

  return webpackMerge.smart(defaultConfig, {
    // modify the webpack config however you'd like to by adding to this object
  });
};
```

```js
const singleSpaTs = require("webpack-config-single-spa-ts");

// Alternatively, you may modify a webpack config directly
const myOtherWebpackConfig = {
  /* ... */
};
const finalConfig = singleSpaDefaults.modifyConfig(myOtherWebpackConfig);
```

## webpack-config-single-spa-react-ts

[Github project](https://github.com/single-spa/create-single-spa/tree/master/packages/webpack-config-single-spa-react-ts)

A shareable, customizable webpack config that creates a webpack config that works with both react and typescript. Note that webpack-config-single-spa-react-ts simply merges the config from webpack-config-single-spa-react with that of webpack-config-single-spa-ts.

### Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev webpack-config-single-spa-react-ts webpack-merge

# or
yarn add --dev webpack-config-single-spa-react-ts webpack-merge
```

### Usage

```js
const webpackMerge = require("webpack-merge");
const singleSpaDefaults = require("webpack-config-single-spa-react-ts");

module.exports = (webpackConfigEnv, argv) => {
  const defaultConfig = singleSpaDefaults({
    // The name of the organization this application is written for
    orgName: "name-of-company",

    // The name of the current project. This usually matches the git repo's name
    projectName: "name-of-project",

    // optional
    // This changes whether package names that start with @your-org-name are
    // treated as webpack externals or not. Defaults to true
    orgPackagesAsExternal: true,

    // See https://webpack.js.org/guides/environment-variables/#root for explanation of webpackConfigEnv
    webpackConfigEnv,

    // The CLI commands in the package.json script that triggered this build
    argv,

    // optional, defaults to 1
    // This is the rootDirectoryLevel that is passed to https://github.com/joeldenning/systemjs-webpack-interop
    rootDirectoryLevel: 1,

    // optional, defaults to false.
    // When true, this removes html-webpack-plugin and standalone-single-spa-webpack-plugin
    disableHtmlGeneration: false,
  });

  return webpackMerge.smart(defaultConfig, {
    // modify the webpack config however you'd like to by adding to this object
  });
};
```

## Custom Webpack configuration

Our shared Webpack configs are intended to be extensible to fit the requirements of your applications. These custom config options can be made in each project's `webpack.config.js` file generated by create-single-spa, or used as the basis for a tailored shared config for your organization.

- Use `require.resolve` to reuse loaders that are included as dependencies
  - this is especially useful for reusing any of webpack-config-single-spa-\*'s dependencies
- webpack-merge [does not support merging configs exported as a function](https://github.com/survivejs/webpack-merge#limitations), which may be relevant if creating shared config packages. webpack-config-single-spa-\* configs require `webpackConfigEnv` and `argv` parameters which necesitates [exporting a config function](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/configuration-types/#exporting-a-function) but return a plain object. This makes it compatible with webpack-merge.
- Use webpack-merge's [`mergeWithRules`](https://github.com/survivejs/webpack-merge#mergewithrules) function to merge and de-duplicate [webpack rules](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/#modulerules)

#### Example: load SVGs as components

You must also install [@svgr/webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@svgr/webpack).

:::info

Available in webpack-config-single-spa@5.3.0+

:::

```js
const singleSpaDefaults = require("webpack-config-single-spa");
const { mergeWithRules } = require("webpack-merge");

const merge = mergeWithRules({
  module: {
    rules: {
      // replace the entire `rule` if the `test` property matches
      test: "match",
      use: "replace",
    },
  },
});

module.exports = (env, argv) => {
  const defaultConfig = singleSpaDefaults({
    orgName: "abcde",
    projectName: "fghij",
    webpackConfigEnv: env,
    argv,
  });

  const config = merge(defaultConfig, {
    module: {
      rules: [
        {
          test: /\.svg$/i,
          use: [{ loader: "@svgr/webpack" }],
        },
      ],
    },
  });

  // console.dir(config, null, 2) // useful for debugging
  return config;
};
```

### Replacing plugins

Use webpack-merge's [`mergeWithCustomize`](https://github.com/survivejs/webpack-merge#mergewithcustomize-customizearray-customizeobject-configuration--configuration) to resolve duplicate plugins or replace instances. Duplicate plugins often result in cryptic errors!

When referencing a loader that is installed as a dependency of webpack-config-single-spa, use [require.resolve](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_require_resolve_request_options) to ensure its path is resolved correctly.

#### Example: replace HtmlWebpackPlugin instance

```js
const { mergeWithCustomize, unique } = require("webpack-merge");
const singleSpaDefaults = require("webpack-config-single-spa");
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin");

const merge = mergeWithCustomize({
  customizeArray: unique(
    "plugins",
    ["HtmlWebpackPlugin"],
    (plugin) => plugin.constructor && plugin.constructor.name,
  ),
});

module.exports = (env, argv) => {
  const orgName = "example";
  const myEnv = process.env.NODE_ENV || "development";

  const defaultConfig = singleSpaDefaults({
    orgName,
    projectName: "custom-root-config",
    webpackConfigEnv: env,
    argv,
  });

  const config = merge(defaultConfig, {
    plugins: [
      new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
        inject: false,
        template: "src/custom.ejs",
        templateParameters: {
          isLocal: env?.isLocal,
          // additional templateParameters can now be supplied
          orgName,
          environment: myEnv,
        },
      }),
    ],
  });

  // console.dir(config, null, 2) // useful for debugging
  return config;
};
```
