[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/single-spa/single-spa-react.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/single-spa/single-spa-react)

single-spa-react is a helper library that helps implement [single-spa registered application](configuration#registering-applications) [lifecycle functions](building-applications.md#registered-application-lifecycle) (bootstrap, mount and unmount) for use with [React](https://reactjs.org/). Check out the [single-spa-react github](https://github.com/single-spa/single-spa-react).

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save single-spa-react

# or
yarn add single-spa-react
```

Alternatively, you can use single-spa-react by adding `<script src="https://unpkg.com/single-spa-react"></script>` and accessing the singleSpaReact global variable.

## Quickstart

Use single-spa-react to create and export single-spa lifecycle functions from your application's entry file.

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOMClient from "react-dom/client";
import rootComponent from "./path-to-root-component.js";
// SingleSpaContext is a react@16.3 (if available) context that provides singleSpa props
import singleSpaReact, { SingleSpaContext } from "single-spa-react";

export const { bootstrap, mount, unmount } = singleSpaReact({
  React,
  ReactDOMClient,
  rootComponent,
  errorBoundary(err, info, props) {
    // https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html
    return <div>This renders when a catastrophic error occurs</div>;
  },
});
```

<summary>Quickstart for React &lt;=17</summary>

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import rootComponent from "./path-to-root-component.js";
import singleSpaReact, { SingleSpaContext } from "single-spa-react";

export const { bootstrap, mount, unmount } = singleSpaReact({
  React,
  ReactDOM,
  rootComponent,
  errorBoundary(err, info, props) {
    // https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html
    return <div>This renders when a catastrophic error occurs</div>;
  },
});
```

</details>

## Options

All options are passed to single-spa-react via the `opts` parameter when calling `singleSpaReact(opts)`. The following options are available:

- `React`: (required) The main React object, which is generally either exposed onto the window or is available via `require('react')` `import React from 'react'`.
- `ReactDOM`: (required) The main ReactDOMbject, which is available via `require('react-dom')` `import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'`.
- `rootComponent`: (required) The top level React component which will be rendered. Can be omitted only if `loadRootComponent` is provided.
- `loadRootComponent`: (optional) A loading function that takes [custom single-spa props](https://single-spa.js.org/docs/building-applications/#custom-props) and returns a promise that resolves with the parcel. This takes the place of the `rootComponent` opt, when provided. It is intended to help people
  who want to lazy load the source code for their root component. The source code will be lazy loaded during the bootstrap lifecycle.
- `errorBoundary`: (optional) A function that accepts `err`, `info`, and `props` and must return the UI for a [React Error Boundary](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html). This is provided as a convenient way of implementing an Error boundary without having to write your own class component for it. The `errorBoundary` function may be provided in the options to singleSpaReact(), or as a custom prop provided by the root config.
- `errorBoundaryClass`: (optional) A React Component class that will be used as the React error boundary. This is an alternative to providing the `errorBoundary` function. The `errorBoundaryClass` may be provided in the options to singleSpaReact(), or as a custom prop provided by the root config.
- `suppressComponentDidCatchWarning`: (optional) A boolean that indicates if single-spa-react should warn when the rootComponent does not implement componentDidCatch. Defaults to false. It is preferred to implement `errorBoundary` instead of suppressing this warning.
- `domElementGetter`: (optional) A function that is given the single-spa props and returns a DOMElement. This dom element is where the
  React application will be bootstrapped, mounted, and unmounted. Note that this opt can be omitted. When omitted, the `domElementGetter` or `domElement`
  [custom single-spa props](https://single-spa.js.org/docs/building-applications/#custom-props) are used.
  To use those, do `singleSpa.registerApplication({ name, app, activeWhen, customProps: {domElementGetter: function() {...}} })` or
  `singleSpa.registerApplication({ name, app, activeWhen, {domElement: document.getElementById(...)} })`. If no dom element can be found through any
  of those methods, then a container div will be created and appended to document.body, by default.
- `parcelCanUpdate`: (optional) A boolean that controls whether an update lifecycle will be created for the returned parcel. Note that option does not impact single-spa applications, but only parcels.
  It is true by default.
- `renderType`: (optional) ENUM of one of the following: `'render'`, `'hydrate'`, `'createRoot'`, `'unstable_createRoot'`, `'createBlockingRoot'`, and `'unstable_createBlockingRoot'`. Defaults to `'render'`. Allows you to choose which ReactDOM render method you want to use for your application. As of single-spa-react@4.6.0, `renderType` can be a function that returns a string, for dynamically calculated renderType.

## Notes

For react@>=16, it is best practice to have each single-spa application's root application implement componentDidCatch in order to avoid
the entire application unmounting unexpectedly when an error occurs. single-spa-react will warn to the console if componentDidCatch is not
implemented. See https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/07/26/error-handling-in-react-16.html for more details.

## SingleSpaContext

## Parcels

single-spa-react can also be used to create a single-spa parcel (instead of a single-spa application). To do so, simply call singleSpaReact() the same as for an application, except without a
domElementGetter (since those are provided by the code that will mount the parcel).

Additionally, single-spa-react provides a `<Parcel>` component to make using framework agnostic single-spa parcels easier. This allows you to put the parcel into your render method's jsx, instead of having to implement componentDidMount and componentWillUnmount.
You can use the Parcel component either by npm installing the library and importing `single-spa-react/parcel` or by adding `<script src="https://unpkg.com/single-spa-react/parcel"></script>` and then accessing the Parcel component with `window.Parcel.default`.

#### Parcel props

- `config` (required): Either a single-spa parcel config object, or a "loading function" that returns a Promise that resolves with the parcel config.
- `wrapWith` (optional): A string [tagName](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/tagName).`<Parcel>` will create a dom node of that type for the parcel to be mounted into. Defaults to `div`
- `wrapStyle`(optional): Styles that will apply to `wrapWith`.
- `wrapClassName` (optional): classNames that will apply to `wrapWith`.
- `appendTo` (optional): A dom element to append the parcel to. By default, this is not needed because the parcel will be mounted in the DOM that the `<Parcel>` component was rendered into. Useful for appending parcels to document.body or other separate parts of the dom.
- `mountParcel` (sometimes required, sometimes not): The `mountParcel` function provided by single-spa. In general, it is preferred to use an application's mountParcel function instead of the
  single-spa's root mountParcel function, so that single-spa can keep track of the parent-child relationship and automatically unmount the application's parcels when the application unmounts.
  Note that if the `<Parcel>` component is being rendered by a single-spa application that uses single-spa-react, it is **unnecessary** to pass in the prop, since `<Parcel>` can get the prop
  from [SingleSpaContext](#singlespacontext)
- `handleError` (optional): A function that will be called with errors thrown by the parcel. If not provided, errors will be thrown on the window, by default.
- `parcelDidMount` (optional): A function that will be called when the parcel finishes loading and mounting.

#### Examples

```jsx
// Use this import path in environments that support package.json exports
// See https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v14.x/docs/api/packages.html#packages_package_entry_points
// and see https://github.com/single-spa/single-spa-react/releases/tag/v3.0.0
// Use this in Webpack 5 and recent versions of Node
import Parcel from 'single-spa-react/parcel'

// Use this import path in environments that don't support package.json exports
// See https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v14.x/docs/api/packages.html#packages_package_entry_points
// and see https://github.com/single-spa/single-spa-react/releases/tag/v3.0.0
// Use this in Webpack 4 and older versions of Node
import Parcel from 'single-spa-react/lib/esm/parcel'


import * as parcelConfig from './my-parcel.js'

// config is required. The parcel will be mounted inside of the
// of a div inside of the react component tree
<Parcel
  config={parcelConfig}

  wrapWith="div"
  handleError={err => console.error(err)}

  customProp1="customPropValue2"
  customProp2="customPropValue2"
/>

// If you pass in an appendTo prop, the parcel will be mounted there instead of
// to a dom node inside of the current react component tree
<Parcel
  config={parcelConfig}
  wrapWith="div"
  appendTo={document.body}
/>

// You can also pass in a "loading function" as the config.
// The loading function must return a promise that resolves with the parcel config.
// The parcel will be mounted once the promise resolves.
<Parcel
  config={() => import('./my-parcel.js')}
  wrapWith="div"
/>

// If you are rendering the Parcel component from a single-spa application, you do not need to pass a mountParcel prop.
// But if you have a separate react component tree that is not rendered by single-spa-react, you **must** pass in a mountParcel prop
// In general, it is preferred to use an application's mountParcel function instead of the single-spa's root mountParcel function,
// so that single-spa can keep track of the parent-child relationship and automatically unmount the application's parcels when the application
// unmounts
<Parcel
  mountParcel={singleSpa.mountParcel}
  config={parcelConfig}
  wrapWith="div"
/>

// Add styles to wrapWith element.
<Parcel
  config={parcelConfig}
  wrapWith="div"
  wrapStyle={{ background: 'black' }}
/>

// Add classNames to wrapWith element.
<Parcel
  config={parcelConfig}
  wrapWith="div"
  wrapClassName="wrapper"
/>

```
